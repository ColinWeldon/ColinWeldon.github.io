      <h1> FINAL PROJECT: Colin's Creative Compliation </h1>
        <p> What is my project about?
          <br> My project consists of three different activity pages where users can complete varius creative tasks. 
          <br> My first activity page is a color by number page, (an idea that was reccomended in the final project ideas document). On this page users are given a festive image made up of many shapes labeled with numbers.
          <br> On the right hand side of the screen a coloing tool is given made up with buttons each labeled with a number and the name of the color that the button repersents. 
          <br>The user is tasked with using this tool to color in each shape with its corresponding number in order to make a picture. My second activity page consists of two mini activities, 
          <br>both involving my bitmoji that we created as one of the first assignments in the class.
