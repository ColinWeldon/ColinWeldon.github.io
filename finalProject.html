      <h1> About Me</h1>
      
        <p> Hi my name is Colin and I am from Warren Rhode Island. I am currently a freshman Mechanical Enginnering major with an aspiring Computer Science minor. 
          <br>I hope that taking CSC106 will help to further my knowledge of programming for future application.      
       </p>
      <p> In my free time I enjoy doing many different things. Firstly I enjoy sports personally being a massive fan of the URI men's basketball team as well as the Red Sox and the Celtics.
        <br> In addition I enjoy hiking and camping with my friends and family as well as cooking meals, producing and creating music, playing videogames on my computer, designing and creating machinery, and hanging out with my friends.
        <br> At home I have a medium sized family consisting of my mother and father as well as my little sister, lily and my little brother, max.
