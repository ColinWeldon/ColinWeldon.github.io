      <h1> FINAL PROJECT: Colin's Creative Compliation </h1>
      <p> <b> What is my project about?</b>
          <br> My project consists of three different activity pages where users can complete varius creative tasks. 
          <br> My first activity page is a color by number page, (an idea that was reccomended in the final project ideas document). On this page users are given a festive image made up of many shapes labeled with numbers.
          <br> On the right hand side of the screen a coloing tool is given made up with buttons each labeled with a number and the name of the color that the button repersents. 
          <br>The user is tasked with using this tool to color in each shape with its corresponding number in order to make a picture. My second activity page consists of two mini activities, 
          <br>both involving my bitmoji that we created as one of the first assignments in the class. The first activity gives the user free reign to do whatever they would like to my drawn bitmoji,
          <br> encouraging creativity as users draw new clothes, details, and acessories on my bitmoji with the drawing tools. The second part of this activity page has the user use my bitmoji for refrence to attempt to redraw it
        <br> using the drawing tools. The final activity page I created gives the user a blank tic tac toe board in which they are free to use the given drawing tools to pick colors to play games of tic tac toe.
        <br> In addition there is also a section at the bottom of the page that is marked as an area for users to keep score of the games they have been playing, either by using the number or tally marks.
        <br> Overall this project allows for the user to both express themselves creatively as well as providing replayable entertainment for all age groups.
