       <p> Hi my name is Colin and this is the homepage of my draft website.
          <br>I will utilize this page as a way to organize my different javascripts that I will be creating throughout my time in CSC106.
          <br>As you can see this page currently lacks any javascripts as I have not yet learned how to create them.
          <br>I will be expanding this site as my course continues sepecifically for the second assignment. Please cheack out my other sites and have a nice day! </p>
