        <p> Hello my name is Colin and this is the homepage of HTML portfolio website for my CSC106 couse at The University of Rhode Island. I utilized both HTML and CSS to create this page. Please spend some time checking out my other pages About me and Javascripts. About me contains some details about my personal life and hobbies as well as some photos, and while I do not currently have any javascripts on my Javascripts page I will in due time once I create them through the course.
          <br>I will be expanding this site as my course continues. Have a nice day! </p>
