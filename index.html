     <h1> Greetings! Welcome to my Programming Portfolio </h1>
        <p> Hello my name is Colin and this is the homepage of HTML portfolio website for my CSC106 couse at The University of Rhode Island. I utilized both HTML and CSS to create this page. 
          <br>Please spend some time checking out my other pages About me and Javascripts. About me contains some details about my personal life and hobbies as well as some photos. 
          <br>While I do not currently have any javascripts on my Javascripts page I will in due time once I create them through the course.
          <br>I will be expanding this site as my course continues. Have a nice day! </p>
